**Distribute Funds 💰⚖️**

This version of *macadamia Wallet* allows you to make batch-transfers to distribute funds from multiple mints according to your desired allocation! Have too much on one mint? Move the sliders and let *macadamia* do the rest! 

**Updated for iOS 26** 

Starting with Build 4, the app is adopting elements of the platform's new design language for a slightly refreshed look! Also included are some bug fixes and general improvements. 👾

**Send Locked Tokens 🔐**

You can now also lock a token to the public key of the receiver! Just scan or paste the key when sending ecash.
