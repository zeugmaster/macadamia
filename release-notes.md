**iMessage Extension 🤖**

This version of *macadamia* includes an iMessage Extension that lets you send ecash straight from the messages app 🚀.

Note: The recipient needs to also have *macadamia* installed to open the message. If they do not have it, 
send them a regular token using the main app's share sheet.

**Input Conversion 💶**

The wallet can now convert amounts to and from your preferred fiat unit. Select it in the Setting tab.
